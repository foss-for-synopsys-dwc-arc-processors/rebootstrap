This project aims to do QA re-bootstraps of Debian architectures. It is
considered experimental, so if it breaks, you keep the pieces. Never use
something other than throw-away chroots. You have been warned.

The bootstrap.sh script tries to re-bootstrap the given (host) architecture
($1) from a build chroot with nothing but sid sources. No binaries from the
host architecture are reused. It expects to be able to install packages and
will leave the filesystem in a dirty state (creating symlinks without tracking
them). It has only ever been tested with pbuilder:

pbuilder --execute bootstrap.sh $host_arch
