This project aims to do QA re-bootstraps of Debian architectures. It is
considered experimental, so if it breaks, you keep the pieces. Never use
something other than throw-away chroots. You have been warned.

The bootstrap.sh script tries to re-bootstrap a given (host) architecture from
a build chroot with nothing but sid sources. No binaries from the host
architecture are reused. It expects to be able to install packages and will
leave the filesystem in a dirty state (creating symlinks without tracking
them). It has only ever been tested with pbuilder:

pbuilder --execute bootstrap.sh HOST_ARCH=$host_arch

The following variables are supposed to be given as parameters (but setting
others is not prohibited):

 * HOST_ARCH: The architecture that shall be bootstrapped.
 * MIRROR: The Debian mirror to use.
 * DEB_BUILD_OPTIONS: Use with care. It may not work without nocheck and
   setting parallel=n with n > 1 breaks some architectures.
 * REPODIR: A directory where built packages should be placed.
